I had to rush to the flughafen because I was going to miss my flight!
I went to the biergarten on St. Patty's day and had green beer.
I needed lots of Brot to soak up the green beer.
So I ran to the nearest baeckerei and said, "Hey! Give me some brot!"
They told me they were out, but they had apfelkuchen. 
So, I took the apfelkuchen and went back to my schloss to enjoy it. 
On the way there a hund tried to take it so I become wettbewerbsfaehig.
